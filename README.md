## Description
The objective of this project is to provide an efficient way to
dispatch trains with optimized route selection and automation
meeting the definite schedule promised to customers thus
enabling the cost savings and guaranteed delivery.
Canadaâ€™s GDP is heavily dependent on the RAILROAD
INDUSTRY for it being the key factor of moving goods in and
around Canada for all imports and exports. Optimizing the route
selection and automation of the dispatch system will bring in
added value to the railroad industry thus enabling cost savings,
GDP growth with more delivery in less time and avoid any human
errors for scheduling different trains in the same route that cause
collisions.<br />
Key attributes in scope will be:<br />
1- Passenger trains and goods trains are in the scope.<br />
2- Truck and crane capabilities to offload the goods are in
scope.<br />
3- Freight trains are out of scope.<br />
4- Route selection based on certain attributes like shortest
route, time constraint and saving fuel.<br />
5- Ability to track live status of trains.<br />
6- System will be capable to send alerts in case of delays for
manual intervention to keep a check.<br />
